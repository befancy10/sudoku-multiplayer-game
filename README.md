##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **pygame library** (will be installed automatically)
- **Network connection** (for multiplayer)

###  Single Computer Setup (Local Testing)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/sudoku-multiplayer-game.git
cd sudoku-multiplayer-game

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install pygame

# 3. Start server (Terminal 1)
cd server
python sudoku_server_simple.py
# Input: Press ENTER for all defaults (0.0.0.0:55555)

# 4. Start client (Terminal 2)
cd client
python sudoku_client.py
# Input: Press ENTER for server IP, enter unique player ID and name

# 5. Start more clients (Terminal 3, 4, etc.)
cd client
python sudoku_client.py
# Use different player IDs for each client
```

###  Network Multiplayer Setup

#### Server Computer Setup:
```bash
# 1. Find your IP address
ipconfig          # Windows
ifconfig          # Linux/macOS

# Example output: IPv4 Address: 10.21.73.115

# 2. Start server
cd server
python sudoku_server_simple.py

# 3. Configuration:
Server host: 0.0.0.0        # Bind to all interfaces
Server port: 55555          # Default port
Max players: 4              # Up to 4 players
```

#### Client Computer(s) Setup:
```bash
# 1. Copy game files to client computer
# You can clone the full repo OR copy just the client folder

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install pygame

# 3. Start client
cd client
python sudoku_client.py

# 4. Configuration:
Server IP: [SERVER_IP]      # e.g., 10.21.73.115
Server port: 55555          # Same as server
Player ID: [unique_id]      # e.g., player1, player2, etc.
Player name: [your_name]    # Display name
```

##  Automated Setup (Recommended)

### Windows Users:
```batch
# Start server
run_server.bat

# Start client (run multiple times for multiple players)
run_client.bat
```

### Linux/macOS Users:
```bash
# Make scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x run_server.sh run_client.sh

# Start server
./run_server.sh

# Start client
./run_client.sh
```

##  How to Play

### Game Controls:
- **Mouse Click**: Select a sudoku cell (highlighted in yellow)
- **Number Keys (1-9)**: Enter number into selected cell
- **DELETE/Backspace**: Clear selected cell
- **ESC**: Deselect current cell

### Scoring System:
- **+10 points**: Correct answer

##  Network Configuration

### Server Configuration:
```python
# Default settings
HOST = "0.0.0.0"      # Bind to all network interfaces
PORT = 55555          # TCP port for game communication
MAX_PLAYERS = 4       # Maximum concurrent players
PROTOCOL = "JSON over TCP"
```

### Client Configuration:
```python
# Connection settings
SERVER_IP = "localhost"     # For local testing
SERVER_IP = "10.21.73.115"  # For network play (use actual server IP)
SERVER_PORT = 55555         # Must match server port
```

### Firewall Setup:
```bash
# Windows
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Sudoku Game" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=55555

# Linux (ufw)
sudo ufw allow 55555/tcp

# macOS
# Configure through System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "python is not recognized"
```bash
# Solution: Install Python and add to PATH
# Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
# During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
```

#### 2. "No module named pygame"
```bash
# Solution: Install pygame
pip install pygame
```

#### 3. "Connection refused"
```bash
# Solutions:
# 1. Make sure server is running first
# 2. Check IP address is correct
# 3. Check firewall settings
# 4. Verify port 55555 is not blocked
```

#### 4. "Address already in use"
```bash
# Solution: Port is busy, either:
# 1. Wait a few seconds and retry
# 2. Use different port in both server and client
# 3. Kill existing process using the port
```

#### 5. Network connectivity issues
```bash
# Test network connection:
ping [SERVER_IP]              # Test basic connectivity
telnet [SERVER_IP] 55555      # Test port accessibility (if telnet available)
```
